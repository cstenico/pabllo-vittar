Yes, girl! Come on! Get with me!
You know, I had an outfit like that in high school

<------------------------------------->

We can try this out
But you gotta know what I'm about
And if we can work it out
You know my body

You know, you know my body
We can try this out
But you gotta know what I'm about
And if we can work it out
You know my body
You know, you know my body

Yeah come over, come over baby
Come in my picture, that's right
'Cause I wasn't trying to get a nice picture by myself

Get in my picture, pose
Get in my frame, close
You're so cool, pose
Yeah, pose, yeah, close

Get in my picture, pose
Get in my frame, close
Tall, sexy, pose
Yeah, pose, yeah, close

Look good when I walk in the party
Ride pink cars like Malibu Barbie
Dressed up, nighty night in a Versace
I love Pabllo, Pabllo loves Charli

Post up like we own it, yeah
Blow right like it's golden, yeah
Look good, damn it's so unfair, yeah
Look good and we know it, yeah

We can try this out (Uh huh, uh huh)
But you gotta know what I'm about (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
And if we can work it out
You know my body
You know, you know my body (Oh)

<------------------------------------->

Yeah come over, come over baby
Come in my picture, that's right
'Cause I wasn't trying to get a nice picture by myself

Get in my picture, pose
Get in my frame, close
You're so cool, pose
Yeah, pose, yeah, close

Get in my picture, pose
Get in my frame, close
Tall, sexy, pose
Yeah, pose, yeah, close
